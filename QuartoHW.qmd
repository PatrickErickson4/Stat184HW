## Question 1

```{r,echo = FALSE}
## dependencies
library(ggplot2)

myFunction <- function(x){
  y <- (cos(4*x) + tan(0.5*x))^4
  return(y)
}

ggplot() +
  stat_function(
    fun = myFunction,
    xlim = c(0, 1),
    n = 1000
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "x",
    y = "h(x)"
  )
```

## Question 2

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

diamonds_prices <- diamonds %>%
group_by(clarity) %>%
summarise(
count = n(),
avg_price = mean(price)
)

#I ordered bars after researching the clarity grades
p <- ggplot(diamonds_prices, aes(
x = factor(clarity, levels = c("I1", "SI2", "SI1", "VS2", "VS1", "VVS2", "VVS1", "IF")),
y = count,
fill = avg_price
)) +

labs(
title = "Number of Diamonds by Clarity",
x = "Clarity",
y = "Count",

```

## Question 3 (footnote located below this line)

all of the data was obtained from the tortillas dataset on kaggle[^1].

[^1]: Rick Chavelas via Kaggle at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/richave/tortilla-prices-in-mexico>

### a) The mean price of all tortillas in 2007 is:

```{r}
#reads in and summarizes and gives the mean of all tortillas in 2007 while saving the mean to a variable
tortillas <- read.csv("C:/Users/patri/OneDrive/Documents/tortilla_data.csv")
average_2007 <- tortillas %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  summarize(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

average_2007
```

### b) The mean price for all tortillas in 2024 is:

```{r}
#summarizes and grabs mean of 2024 tortillas
average_2024 <- tortillas %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>%
  summarize(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

average_2024

```

### c) The percentage change in price of tortillas from 2007 to 2024 is

```{r}
cat((average_2024$average_price/average_2007$average_price)*100, "%")

```

### d) Average prices for all 6 states over the years

```{r}

# Summarize average price by year and state
average_per_state <- tortillas %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create the multi-line ggplot
q <- ggplot(average_per_state, aes(x = year, y = average_price, color = state, group = state)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  
  geom_point(size = 2) +  
  labs(
    title = "Average Price of Tortillas by State and Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Price",
    color = "State"  
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

q
```

### e) Summary Statistics of Tortilla Prices by State in 2016

The table below shows the summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation) of tortilla prices in 2016 for each state.

```{r}

# Filter data for 2016 and summarize statistics by state
summary2016 <- tortillas %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_price = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_price = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

summary2016
```

### f) Average price of a tortilla in Nuevo Le贸n by Store Type

The plot shows trends in average tortilla prices for small businesses and large corporations in Nuevo Le贸n over the years.

```{r}


# Filter data for Nuevo Le贸n from 2007 to 2024
nuevo_data <- tortillas %>%
  filter(state == "NuevoLeon") %>%
  group_by(year, storeType) %>%
  summarize(average_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create the overlapping plot
s <- ggplot(nuevo_data, aes(x = year, y = average_price, color = storeType, group = storeType)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Average Price of Tortillas in Nuevo Le贸n by Store Type",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Price",
    color = "Store Type",  # Legend title
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

s
```
